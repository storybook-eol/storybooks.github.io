By default, Storybook comes with a single addon, which is [actions](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/addon-actions). But you can use any third party addons distributed via NPM.

Here's how to do it.

Now we are going to use an addon called [Notes](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/addon-notes). Basically, it allows you to write notes for your stories.

First, you need to create a file called `addons.js` inside the storybook config directory and add the following content:

~~~js
import '@kadira/storybook/addons';
~~~

This will load our default addons.

Then install the notes addon with:

~~~sh
npm i --save '@kadira/storybook-addon-notes';
~~~


After that, add it to the addons.js like this:

~~~js
import '@kadira/storybook/addons';
import '@kadira/storybook-addon-notes/register';
~~~


Then you'll be able to see those notes when you are viewing the story.

Now when you are writing a story it like this and add some notes:

~~~js
import React from 'react';
import { storiesOf, action, linkTo } from '@kadira/storybook';
import Button from './Button';
import { WithNotes } from '@kadira/storybook-addon-notes';

storiesOf('Button', module)
  .add('with some emoji', () => (
    <WithNotes notes={'Here we use some emoji as the Button text. Isn\\'t it look nice?'}>
      <Button onClick={action('clicked')}>😀 😎 👍 💯</Button>
    </WithNotes>
  ));
~~~

Then you'll be able to see those notes when you are viewing the story.

Just like this, you can install any other addon and use it. Have a look at our [addon gallery](/docs/react-storybook/addons/addon-gallery) to discover more addons.

> This particular addon has created a panel in Storybook. Some addons may not create a panel and may use some other Storybook platform features.
>
> So, look at the addon’s own documentation on how to use it.
