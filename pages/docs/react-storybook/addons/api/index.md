## Core Addon API

This is the core addon API. This is how to get the addon API:

```js
import addonAPI from '@storybook/addons';
```

Have a look at the API methods for more details:

### addonAPI.getChannel()

Get an instance to the channel where you can communicate with the manager and the preview. You can find this in both the addon register code and in your addonâ€™s wrapper component (where used inside a story).

It has a NodeJS [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) compatible API. So, you can use it to emit events and listen for events.

### addonAPI.register()

This method allows you to register an addon and get the storybook API. You can do this only in the Manager App.
See how we can use this:

```js
// Register the addon with a unique name.
addonAPI.register('kadira/notes', (storybookAPI) => {

});
```

Now you'll get an instance to our StorybookAPI. See the [api docs](/docs/react-storybook/addons/api#storybook-api) for Storybook API regarding using that.

### addonAPI.addPanel()

This method allows you to add a panel to Storybook. (Storybook's Action Logger is a panel). You can do this only in the Manager App.
See how you can use this method:

```js
const MyPanel = () => (
  <div>
    This is a panel.
  </div>
);

// give a unique name for the panel
addonAPI.addPanel('kadira/notes/panel', {
  title: 'Notes',
  render: () => (
    <MyPanel />
  ),
});
```

As you can see, you can set any React Component as the panel. Currently, it's just a text. But you can do anything you want. You should specify the panel title. It could be a plain text or a function returning any React Component.

You also pass the channel and the Storybook API into that. See:

```js
addonAPI.register('kadira/notes', (storybookAPI) => {
  // Also need to set a unique name to the panel.
  addonAPI.addPanel('kadira/notes/panel', {
    title: 'Notes',
    render: () => (
      <Notes channel={addons.getChannel()} api={storybookAPI}/>
    ),
  })
})
```

## Storybook API

Storybook API allows you to access different functionalities of Storybook UI. You can move an instance to the Storybook API when you register an addon.

Let's have a look at API methods.

### storybookAPI.selectStory()

With this method, you can select a story via an API. This method accepts two parameters.

1.  story kind name
2.  story name (optional)

Let's say you've got a story like this:

```js
storiesOf('Button', module)
  .add('with text', () => (
    <Button onClick={action('clicked')}>Hello Button</Button>
  ));
```

This is how you can select the above story:

```js
storybookAPI.selectStory('Button', 'with text');
```

### storybookAPI.setQueryParams()

This method allows you to set query string parameters. You can use that as temporary storage for addons. Here's how you set query params.

```js
storybookAPI.setQueryParams({
  abc: 'this is abc',
  bbc: 'this is bbc',
});
```

> If you need to remove a query param, use `null` for that. For an example, let's say we need to remove bbc query param. This is how we do it:

```js
storybookAPI.setQueryParams({
  bbc: null,
});
```

### storybookAPI.getQueryParam()

This method allows you to get a query param set by above API `setQueryParams`. For example, let's say we need to get the bbc query param. Then this how we do it:

```js
storybookAPI.getQueryParam('bbc');
```

### storybookAPI.onStory(fn)

This method allows you to register a handler function which will be called whenever the user navigates between stories.

```js
storybookAPI.onStory((kind, story) => console.log(kind, story));
```
