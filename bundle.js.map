So, you can use it to emit events and listen for events.</p>\\n<h3>addonAPI.register()</h3>\\n<p>This method allows you to register an addon and get the storybook API.

Basically, Storybook has a <strong>Manager App</strong> and a <strong>Preview Area</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Manager App is the client side UI for Storybook. Preview Area is the place where the story is rendered. Usually the Preview Area is an iframe.</p>\\n<p>When you select a story from the Manager App, the relevant story is rendered inside the Preview Area.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/storybook-components.png\\\" alt=\\\"Storybook Components\\\"></p>\\n<p>As shown in the above image, there’s a communication channel that the Manager App and Preview Area use to communicate with each other.</p>\\n<h2>Capabilities</h2>\\n<p>With an addon, you can add more functionality to Storybook. Here are a few things you could do:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Add a panel to Storybook (like Action Logger).</li>\\n<li>Interact with the story and the panel.</li>\\n<li>Set and get URL query params.</li>\\n<li>Select a story.</li>\\n<li>Register keyboard shortcuts (coming soon).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>With this, you can write some pretty cool addons.

(In this example, we add it just for the <strong>MyComponent</strong> story group.)</p>\\n<p>But, you can also add a decorator <strong>globally</strong> and it’ll be applied to all the stories you create. This is how to add a decorator like that:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { configure, addDecorator } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\naddDecorator(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">story</span>) =&gt;</span> (\\n  <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">style</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{{textAlign:</span> '<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">center</span>'}}&gt;</span>\\n    {story()}\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n));\\n\\nconfigure(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  ...\\n}, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Linking stories</h2>\\n<p>With <code>linkTo</code> you can link stories together to build demos and prototypes directly from your UI components. (Similar to <a href=\\\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\\\">InVision</a> and <a href=\\\"https://framerjs.com/\\\">Framer.js</a>)</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, linkTo } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>\\n\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Button'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'First'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{linkTo(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span>', '<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Second</span>')}&gt;</span>Go to \\\"Second\\\"<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ))\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Second'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{linkTo(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span>', '<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">First</span>')}&gt;</span>Go to \\\"First\\\"<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ));\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>With that, you can link an event in a component to any story in the Storybook.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>First parameter is the story kind (what you named with storiesOf).</li>\\n<li>Second parameter is the story name (what you named with .add).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>You can also pass a function instead for any of above parameters. That function accepts arguments emitted by the event and it should return a string. For example:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">linkTo(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> =&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Button'</span>, () =&gt; <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Second'</span>)\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Managing stories</h2>\\n<p>Storybook has a very simple API to write stories. With that, you can’t display nested stories.\\n<em><strong>This is something we’ve done purposely.</strong></em></p>\\n<p>But you might ask, how do I manage stories If I have many of them? Here’s how different developers address this issue. Therefore, there’s no need to build a built-in feature for this (at least in the short term).</p>\\n<h3>Prefix with dots</h3>\\n<p>For example, you can prefix story names with a dot (<code>.</code>):</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">storiesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'core.Button'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then you can filter stories to display only the stories you want to see.</p>\\n<h3>Run multiple storybooks</h3>\\n<p>You can run multiple storybooks for different kinds of stories (or components). To do that, you can create different NPM scripts to start different stories. See:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">{\\n   ...\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook-for-theme\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook -p 9001 -c .storybook-theme\\\"</span>\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook-for-app\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook -p 8001 -c .storybook-app\\\"</span>\\n   }\\n   ...\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Use multiple repos</h3>\\n<p>This is a popular option. You can create different repos for different kinds of UI components and have a storybook for each of them. Here are some ways to separate them:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Have one repo for the theme, and one for the app.</li>\\n<li>Have one repo for each UI component and use those in different apps.</li>\\n<li>Have a few repos for different kinds of UI components and use them in different apps.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 518 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"id\":\"add-custom-head-tags\",\"title\":\"Add Custom Head Tags\",\"body\":\"<p>Sometimes, you may need to add different tags to the HTML head.

But if you already have your own Webpack setup, that’s not useable.</p>\\n<p>That’s why we allow you to customize our Webpack setup. There are a few ways to do it. Let’s discuss:</p>\\n<h2>Simple Mode</h2>\\n<p>Let’s say you want to add <a href=\\\"http://sass-lang.com/\\\">SASS</a> support to Storybook. This is how to do it.\\nSimply add the following content to a file called <code>webpack.config.js</code> in your Storybook config directory (<code>.storybook</code> by default ).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> path = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'path'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.scss$/</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"style\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"css\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"sass\\\"</span>],\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: path.resolve(__dirname, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../'</span>)\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Since this config file stays in the Storybook directory, you need to set the include path as above. If the config directory stays in a different directory, you need to set the include path relative to that.</p>\\n<p>You also need to install the loaders (style, css, and sass) used in above config manually.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Once you create this <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, Storybook won’t load the <a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/configurations/default-config\\\">default Webpack config</a> other than loading JS files with the Babel loader.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>Supported Webpack Options</h3>\\n<p>You can add any kind of Webpack configuration options with the above config, whether they are plugins, loaders, or aliases.\\nBut you won’t be able to change the following config options:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>entry</li>\\n<li>output</li>\\n<li>js loader with babel</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Full Control Mode</h2>\\n<p>Sometimes, you will want to have full control over the webpack configuration. Maybe you want to add different configurations for dev and production environments. That’s where you can use our full control mode.</p>\\n<p>To enable that, you need to export a <strong>function</strong> from the above <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, just like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Export a function. Accept the base config as the only param.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">storybookBaseConfig, configType</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// configType has a value of 'DEVELOPMENT' or 'PRODUCTION'</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// You can change the configuration based on that.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 'PRODUCTION' is used when building the static version of storybook.</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Make whatever fine-grained changes you need</span>\\n  storybookBaseConfig.module.loaders.push({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.scss$/</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"style\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"css\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"sass\\\"</span>],\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: path.resolve(__dirname, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../'</span>)\\n  });\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Return the altered config</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> storybookBaseConfig;\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Storybook uses the config returned from the above function. So, try to edit the <code>storybookBaseConfig</code> with care. Make sure to preserve the following config options:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>entry</li>\\n<li>output</li>\\n<li>first loader in the module.loaders (Babel loader for JS)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Other than that, you should try to keep the default set of plugins.</p>\\n<h2>Extending The Default Config</h2>\\n<p>You may want to keep Storybook’s <a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/configurations/default-config\\\">default config</a>, but just need to extend it. If so, this is how you do it using the Full Control Mode.\\nAdd following content to the <code>webpack.config.js</code> in your Storybook config directory.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// load the default config generator.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> genDefaultConfig = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook/dist/server/config/defaults/webpack.config.js'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">config, env</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> config = genDefaultConfig(config, env);\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Extend it as you need.</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> config;\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Using Your Existing Config</h2>\\n<p>You may have an existing Webpack config for your project. So, you may need to copy and paste some config items into Storybook’s custom Webpack config file.</p>\\n<p>But you don’t need to. There are a few options:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Simply import your main Webpack config into Storybook’s <code>webpack.config.js</code> and use the loaders and plugins used in that.</li>\\n<li>Create a new file with common Webpack options and use it in both inside the main Webpack config and inside Storybook’s <code>webpack.config.js</code>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 522 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"id\":\"default-config\",\"title\":\"Default Config\",\"body\":\"<p>Storybook has a default Webpack setup which is similar to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">Create React App</a>.\\nLet’s learn about the default config comes with Storybook.</p>\\n<h2>Babel</h2>\\n<p>We use Babel for JavaScript(ES6) transpiling. Here are some key features of Storybook’s Babel configurations.</p>\\n<h3>ES2016+ Support</h3>\\n<p>We have added ES2016 support with Babel for transpiling your JS code. In addition to that, we’ve added a few experimental features, like object spreading and async await. Check out our <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/blob/master/packages/react-storybook/src/server/config/babel.js#L19\\\">source</a> to learn more about these plugins.</p>\\n<h3>.babelrc support</h3>\\n<p>If your project has a <code>.babelrc</code> file, we’ll use that instead of the default config file. So, you could use any babel plugins or presets that you have used in your project with Storybook.</p>\\n<h2>Webpack</h2>\\n<p>We use Webpack to serve and load JavaScript modules for the web. We’ve added some Webpack loaders to bring some good defaults. (This setup is very close to what you get with the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">Create React App</a>.)</p>\\n<h3>CSS Support</h3>\\n<p>You can simply import CSS files wherever you want, whether it’s in the storybook config file, a UI component, or inside a story definition file.</p>\\n<p>Basically, you can import CSS like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// locally</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./styles.css'</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// or from NPM modules</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'</span>;\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Image and Static File Support</h3>\\n<p>You can also import images and media files directly via JavaScript. This helps you to write stories with media files easily. This is how to do it:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, action } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> imageFile <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./static/image.png'</span>;\\n\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&lt;img&gt;'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with a image'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">img</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{imageFile}</span> /&gt;</span>\\n  ));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>When you are building a storybook, we’ll also export the imported image. So, this is a good approach to loading all of your static content.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Storybook also has a way to mention static directories via the -s option of the <code>react-storybook</code> and <code>build-storybook</code> commands.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>JSON Loader</h3>\\n<p>You can import <code>.json</code> files, as you do with Node.js. This will also allow you to use NPM projects, which imports <code>.json</code> files inside them.</p>\\n<h2>NPM Modules</h2>\\n<p>You can use any of the NPM modules installed on your project. You can simply import and use them.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Unfortunately, we don’t support Meteor packages. If your UI component includes one or more Meteor packages, try to avoid using them in UI components.\\nIf they are containers, you can use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kadirahq/react-stubber\\\">React Stubber</a> to use them in Storybook.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 523 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"body\":\"<hr>\\n<h2>id: 'env-vars’\\ntitle: ‘Using Environment Variables’</h2>\\n<p>Sometimes, we may use configuration items inside Storybook.

But, you normally don’t need to do that since we set a reasonable default value for it.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>When running <code>npm run storybook</code>, we set NODE_ENV to ‘development’</li>\\n<li>When building storybook, we set NODE_ENV to ‘production’</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 524 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"id\":\"serving-static-files\",\"title\":\"Serving Static Files\",\"body\":\"<p>It’s often useful to load static files like images and videos when creating components and stories.</p>\\n<p>Storybook provides two ways to do that.</p>\\n<h2>1.

Now you can use static files in the public directory in your components or stories like this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, action } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// assume image.png is located in the \\\"public\\\" directory.</span>\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&lt;img&gt;'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with a image'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">img</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"/image.png\\\"</span> /&gt;</span>\\n  ));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>You can also pass a list of directories, instead of a single directory, as shown below.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook -s ./public,./static -p 9001\\\"</span>\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Absolute versus relative paths</h2>\\n<p>Sometimes, you may want to deploy your storybook into a subpath, like <a href=\\\"https://kadira-samples.github.io/react-button\\\">https://kadira-samples.github.io/react-button</a>.</p>\\n<p>In this case, you need to have all your images and media files with relative paths. Otherwise, Storybook cannot locate those files.</p>\\n<p>If you load static content via importing, this is automatic and you do not have to do anything.</p>\\n<p>If you are using a static directory, then you need to use <em>relative paths</em> to load images.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 525 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"id\":\"css-style-testing\",\"title\":\"CSS/Style Testing\",\"body\":\"<p>We can also use Storybook as the base for CSS/Style testing with stories as the base.

There are also a lot of tools and techniques we can use.</p>\\n<h2>Reasons for Testing</h2>\\n<p>Before we talk about testing, we need to think about why we need to test. There are many reasons; here are some of our reasons:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>To find bugs.</li>\\n<li>To make sure things won’t break between new code commits.</li>\\n<li>To keep tests as living documentations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Specifically, testing is important when working with teams since it allows different people the ability to contribute with confidence.</p>\\n<h2>Different Aspects of UI Testing</h2>\\n<p>We refer UI for many things. To put this in focus, let’s narrow it down to React based user interfaces.</p>\\n<h3>1. Structural Testing</h3>\\n<p>Here we’ll focus on the structure of the UI and how it’s laid out. For an example, let’s say we have a “login component” as shown below:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/login_form.png\\\" alt=\\\"Login Form\\\"></p>\\n<p>For structural testing, we are testing whether or not it has following content:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A title with “Login in to Facebook”</li>\\n<li>Two inputs for the username and password.</li>\\n<li>A submit button.</li>\\n<li>An error screen to show errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For React, we have been using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme\\\">Enzyme</a> as a way to do structural testing, but now we can also use <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html\\\">Jest’s snapshot testing</a> to make things even more simple.</p>\\n<h3>2. Interaction Testing</h3>\\n<p>UI is all about interacting with the user. We do this with a bunch of UI elements, such as buttons, links, and input elements. With interaction testing, we need to test if they are working properly.</p>\\n<p>Let’s again use the above login component as an example. It should do these things:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>When we click the submit button, it should give us the username and password.</li>\\n<li>When we click the “Forgotten Account” link, it should redirect to a new page.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We have few ways to do this type of testing with React. The simple way is to use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme\\\">Enzyme</a>.</p>\\n<h3>3. CSS/Style Testing</h3>\\n<p>UI is all about styles (whether they’re simple, beautiful, or even ugly). With style testing, we are evaluating the look and feel of our UI components between code changes. This is a pretty complex subject and usually we do it by comparing images.</p>\\n<p>If we are using inline styles all the way, we can use JEST snapshot testing. But to get even better results, we should consider using tools such as:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS\\\">BackstopJS</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS\\\">PhantomCSS</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/gemini-testing/gemini\\\">Gemini</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/Galooshi/happo\\\">Happo</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>4. Manual Testing</h3>\\n<p>All the above sections are about testing with automated tools. But since we are building UI for humans, we must also manually test them to see how they feel.</p>\\n<p>Another reason for manual testing is for the better user experience.</p>\\n<p>We should always try to test our UI with the naked eye. For this, we can simply use our existing Storybook.This is something that we can’t automate(yet) and takes time. But it would be great if we could do this once in a while (especially with a major code changes).</p>\\n<h2>How Storybook Can Help Us</h2>\\n<p>A <strong>story</strong> is a smallest unit in Storybook. It’s a fully functioning UI element where the input can be used for any of the testing methods we’ve mentioned above.</p>\\n<p>Let’s look at how Storybook can help you do the above mentioned different aspects of testing.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/testing/structural-testing\\\">Structural Testing with StoryShots</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/testing/interaction-testing\\\">Interaction Testing with Specs Addon</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/testing/css-style-testing\\\">Storybook as the Base for CSS/Style Testing</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/testing/manual-testing\\\">Storybook for Manual UI Testing</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 529 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"id\":\"structural-testing\",\"title\":\"Structural Testing\",\"body\":\"<p>For React, <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html\\\">Jest’s snapshot testing</a> is the best way to do Structural Testing. It’s painless to use and maintain. We’ve integrated Jest’s snapshot testing directly into Storybook using a new tool called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storyshots\\\">StoryShots</a>. Now we can simply use existing stories as the input for snapshot testing.</p>\\n<h2>What’s Snapshot Testing?</h2>\\n<p>With Snapshot testing, we keep a file copy of the structure of UI components. Think of it like a set of HTML sources.</p>\\n<p>Then, after we’ve completed any UI changes, we compare new snapshots with the snapshots that we kept in the file.</p>\\n<p>If things are not the same, we can do two things:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>We can consider new snapshots that show the current state, and then update them as new snapshots.</li>\\n<li>We can find the root cause for the change and fix our code.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We can also commit these snapshots directly into the source code.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Using StoryShots</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/storyshots\\\">StoryShots</a> is our integration between Storybook and Jest Snapshot Testing. It’s pretty simple to use.</p>\\n<p>First, make sure you are inside a Storybook-enabled repo (make sure it has few stories).\\nThen, install StoryShots into your app with:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">npm i -D @kadira/storyshots\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then, add the following NPM script into your package.json:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"test-storybook\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"storyshots\\\"</span>\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can run the above command with:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">npm run <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">test</span>-storybook\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This will save the initial set of snapshots inside your Storybook config directory.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/storyshots-first-run.png\\\" alt=\\\"StoryShots First \\\"></p>\\n<p>After you complete any changes, you can run the above NPM script again and find our structural changes.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/storyshots-diff-view.png\\\" alt=\\\"StoryShots Diff View\\\"></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>StoryShots also comes with a few important <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/storyshots#key-features\\\">productive features</a> that can be customized.

This is how to get the addon API:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> addonAPI <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook-addons'</span>;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Have a look at the API methods for more details:</p>\\n<h3>addonAPI.getChannel()</h3>\\n<p>Get an instance to the channel where you can communicate with the manager and the preview. You can find this in both the addon register code and in your addon’s wrapper component (where used inside a story).</p>\\n<p>It has a NodeJS <a href=\\\"https://nodejs.org/api/events.html\\\">EventEmitter</a> compatible API. So, you can use it to emit events and listen for events.</p>\\n<h3>addonAPI.register()</h3>\\n<p>This method allows you to register an addon and get the storybook API. You can do this only in the Manager App.\\nSee how we can use this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Register the addon with a unique name.</span>\\naddonAPI.register(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'kadira/notes'</span>, (storybookAPI) =&gt; {\\n\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you’ll get an instance to our StorybookAPI. See the <a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/addons/api#storybook-api\\\">api docs</a> for Storybook API regarding using that.</p>\\n<h3>addonAPI.addPanel()</h3>\\n<p>This method allows you to add a panel to Storybook. (Storybook’s Action Logger is a panel). You can do this only in the Manager App.\\nSee how you can use this method:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> MyPanel = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> =&gt;</span> (\\n  <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n    This is a panel.\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// give a unique name for the panel</span>\\naddonAPI.addPanel(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'kadira/notes/panel'</span>, {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">title</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Notes'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> =&gt;</span> (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">MyPanel</span> /&gt;</span>\\n  ),\\n});\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>As you can see, you can set any React Component as the panel. Currently, it’s just a text. But you can do anything you want.</p>\\n<p>You also pass the channel and the Storybook API into that. See:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">addonAPI.register(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'kadira/notes'</span>, (storybookAPI) =&gt; {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Also need to set a unique name to the panel.</span>\\n  addonAPI.addPanel(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'kadira/notes/panel'</span>, {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">title</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Notes'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> =&gt;</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Notes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">channel</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{addons.getChannel()}</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">api</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{storybookAPI}/</span>&gt;</span>\\n    ),\\n  })\\n})\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<h2>Storybook API</h2>\\n<p>Storybook API allows you to access different functionalities of Storybook UI. You can move an instance to the Storybook API when you register an addon.</p>\\n<p>Let’s have a look at API methods.</p>\\n<h3>storybookAPI.selectStory()</h3>\\n<p>With this method, you can select a story via an API.

Basically, Storybook has a <strong>Manager App</strong> and a <strong>Preview Area</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Manager App is the client side UI for Storybook. Preview Area is the place where the story is rendered. Usually the Preview Area is an iframe.</p>\\n<p>When you select a story from the Manager App, the relevant story is rendered inside the Preview Area.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/storybook-components.png\\\" alt=\\\"Storybook Components\\\"></p>\\n<p>As shown in the above image, there’s a communication channel that the Manager App and Preview Area use to communicate with each other.</p>\\n<h2>Capabilities</h2>\\n<p>With an addon, you can add more functionality to Storybook. Here are a few things you could do:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Add a panel to Storybook (like Action Logger).</li>\\n<li>Interact with the story and the panel.</li>\\n<li>Set and get URL query params.</li>\\n<li>Select a story.</li>\\n<li>Register keyboard shortcuts (coming soon).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>With this, you can write some pretty cool addons. Look at our <a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/addons/addon-gallery\\\">Addon gallery</a> to have a look at some sample addons.</p>\\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\\n<p>Let’s write a simple addon for Storybook. It’s a Notes addon on which you can display some notes for a story.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Just for the simplicity, we’ll write the addon right inside our app. But we can easily move it into a separate NPM module.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>How it looks</h2>\\n<p>We write a story for our addon like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, action } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> Button <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./Button'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { WithNotes } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../notes-addon'</span>;\\n\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Button'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with text'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">notes</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">This</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">is</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">a</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">very</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">simple</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">and</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">you</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">can</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">click</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">on</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">it.</span>'}&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{action(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">clicked</span>')}&gt;</span>Hello Button<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ))\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with some emoji'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">notes</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Here</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">we</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">use</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">some</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">emoji</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">as</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">the</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">text.</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Isn</span>\\\\'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">t</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">it</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">look</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">nice</span>?'}&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{action(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">clicked</span>')}&gt;</span>😀 😎 👍 💯<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ));\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then it will appear in the Notes panel like this:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/stories-with-notes.png\\\" alt=\\\"With notes\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Setup</h2>\\n<p>First, create an <code>addons.js</code> inside the Storybook config directory and add the following content to it.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Storybook's default addons</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook/addons'</span>;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ll use this file shortly to register the Notes addon we are building.</p>\\n<p>Now we need to create two files, <code>register.js</code> and <code>index.js,</code> inside a directory called <code>src/notes-addon</code>.</p>\\n<h2>The Addon</h2>\\n<p>Let’s add the following content to the <code>index.js</code>. It will expose a class called <code>WithNotes</code>, which wraps our story.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> addons <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook-addons'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">WithNotes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">extends</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">React</span>.<span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Component</span> </span>{\\n  render() {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> { children, notes } = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> channel = addons.getChannel();\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// send the notes to the channel.</span>\\n    channel.emit(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'kadira/notes/add_notes'</span>, notes);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// return children elements.</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> children;\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In this case, our component can access something called the channel. It lets us communicate with the panel (where we display notes). It has a NodeJS <a href=\\\"https://nodejs.org/api/events.html\\\">EventEmitter</a> compatible API.</p>\\n<p>In the above case, it will emit the notes text to the channel, so our panel can listen to it.</p>\\n<p>Then add the following code to the register.js.</p>\\n<p>See: <a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/arunoda/fb3859840ff616cc5ea0fa3ef8e3f358\\\">https://gist.github.com/arunoda/fb3859840ff616cc5ea0fa3ef8e3f358</a></p>\\n<p>It will register our addon and add a panel. In this case, the panel represents a React component called <code>Notes</code>. That component has access to the channel and storybook api.</p>\\n<p>Then it will listen to the channel and render the notes text on the panel. Have a look at the above annotated code.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>In this example, we are only sending messages from the Preview Area to the Manager App (our panel). But we can do it the other way around as well.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>It also listens to another event, called onStory, in the storybook API, which fires when the user selects a story. We use that event to clear the previous notes when selecting a story.</p>\\n<h3>Register the addon</h3>\\n<p>Now, finally, we need to register the addon by importing it to the <code>.storybook/addons.js</code> file.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Storybook's default addons</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook/addons'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Our addon</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../src/notes-addon/register'</span>;\\n</code></pre>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Above code runs in the Manager App but not in the preview area.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>That’s it.

If you want to set up Storybook manually, this is the guide for you.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>This will also help you to understand how Storybook works.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Basics</h2>\\n<p>Storybook has its own Webpack setup and a dev server. Webpack setup is very similar to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">Create React App</a>, but allows you to configure as you want.</p>\\n<p>In this guide, we are trying to set up Storybook for your React project.</p>\\n<h2>Add @kadira/storybook</h2>\\n<p>First of all, you need to add <code>@kadira/storybook</code> to your project. To do that, simply run:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">npm i --save-dev @kadira/storybook\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Add react and react-dom</h2>\\n<p>Make sure that you have <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code> in your dependencies as well:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">npm i --save react react-dom\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then add the following NPM script to your package json in order to start the storybook later in this guide:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">{\\n  ...\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"storybook\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook -p 9001 -c .storybook\\\"</span>\\n  }\\n  ...\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Create the config file</h2>\\n<p>Storybook can be configured in several different ways. That’s why we need a config directory. We’ve added a <code>-c</code> option to the above NPM script mentioning <code>.storybook</code> as the config directory.</p>\\n<p>For the basic Storybook configuration file, you don’t need to do much, but simply tell Storybook where to find stories.</p>\\n<p>To do that, simply create a file at <code>.storybook/config.js</code> with the following content:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { configure } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">loadStories</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../stories/index.js'</span>);\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// You can require as many stories as you need.</span>\\n}\\n\\nconfigure(loadStories, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>That’ll load stories in <code>../stories/index.js</code>.</p>\\n<p>Just like that, you can load stories from wherever you want to.</p>\\n<h2>Write your stories</h2>\\n<p>Now you can write some stories inside the <code>../stories/index.js</code> file, like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, action } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Button'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with text'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{action(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">clicked</span>')}&gt;</span>Hello Button<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ))\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with some emoji'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{action(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">clicked</span>')}&gt;</span>😀 😎 👍 💯<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ));\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Story is a single state of your component. In the above case, there are two stories for the native button component:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>with text</li>\\n<li>with some emoji</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>Run your Storybook</h2>\\n<p>Now everything is ready. Simply run your storybook with:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">npm run storybook\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then you can see all your stories, like this:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/basic-stories.png\\\" alt=\\\"Basic stories\\\"></p>\\n<p>Now you can change components and write stories whenever you need to. You’ll get those changes into Storybook in a snap with the help of Webpack’s HMR API.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/react-storybook/basics/slow-start-guide/index.md\n// module id = 516\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"id\":\"writing-stories\",\"title\":\"Writing Stories\",\"body\":\"<p>Storybook is all about writing stories.

Then you will want to load them at once. Simply edit your config directory at <code>.storybook/config.js</code> as follows:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { configure } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> req = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>.context(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../src/components'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">true</span>, /\\\\.stories\\\\.js$/)\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">loadStories</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  req.keys().forEach(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">filename</span>) =&gt;</span> req(filename))\\n}\\n\\nconfigure(loadStories, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Here we use Webpack’s <a href=\\\"https://webpack.github.io/docs/context.html#require-context\\\">require.context</a> to load modules dynamically. Have a look at the relevant Webpack <a href=\\\"https://webpack.github.io/docs/context.html#require-context\\\">docs</a> to learn more about how to use require.context.</p>\\n<h2>Using Decorators</h2>\\n<p>A decorator is a way to wrap a story with a common set of component(s). Let’s say you want to center all your stories. Here is how we can do this with a decorator:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> MyComponent <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../my_component'</span>;\\n\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'MyComponent'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .addDecorator(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">story</span>) =&gt;</span> (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">style</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{{textAlign:</span> '<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">center</span>'}}&gt;</span>\\n      {story()}\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ))\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'without props'</span>, () =&gt; (&lt;MyComponent /&gt;))\\n  .add('with some props', () =&gt; (&lt;MyComponent text=\\\"The Comp\\\"/&gt;));\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Here we only add the decorator for the current set of stories. (In this example, we add it just for the <strong>MyComponent</strong> story group.)</p>\\n<p>But, you can also add a decorator <strong>globally</strong> and it’ll be applied to all the stories you create. This is how to add a decorator like that:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { configure, addDecorator } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\naddDecorator(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">story</span>) =&gt;</span> (\\n  <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">style</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{{textAlign:</span> '<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">center</span>'}}&gt;</span>\\n    {story()}\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n));\\n\\nconfigure(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  ...\\n}, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Linking stories</h2>\\n<p>With <code>linkTo</code> you can link stories together to build demos and prototypes directly from your UI components. (Similar to <a href=\\\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\\\">InVision</a> and <a href=\\\"https://framerjs.com/\\\">Framer.js</a>)</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, linkTo } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>\\n\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Button'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'First'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{linkTo(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span>', '<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Second</span>')}&gt;</span>Go to \\\"Second\\\"<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ))\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Second'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{linkTo(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span>', '<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">First</span>')}&gt;</span>Go to \\\"First\\\"<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ));\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>With that, you can link an event in a component to any story in the Storybook.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>First parameter is the story kind (what you named with storiesOf).</li>\\n<li>Second parameter is the story name (what you named with .add).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>You can also pass a function instead for any of above parameters. That function accepts arguments emitted by the event and it should return a string. For example:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">linkTo(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span> =&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Button'</span>, () =&gt; <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Second'</span>)\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Managing stories</h2>\\n<p>Storybook has a very simple API to write stories. With that, you can’t display nested stories.\\n<em><strong>This is something we’ve done purposely.</strong></em></p>\\n<p>But you might ask, how do I manage stories If I have many of them? Here’s how different developers address this issue. Therefore, there’s no need to build a built-in feature for this (at least in the short term).</p>\\n<h3>Prefix with dots</h3>\\n<p>For example, you can prefix story names with a dot (<code>.</code>):</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">storiesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'core.Button'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then you can filter stories to display only the stories you want to see.</p>\\n<h3>Run multiple storybooks</h3>\\n<p>You can run multiple storybooks for different kinds of stories (or components). To do that, you can create different NPM scripts to start different stories. See:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">{\\n   ...\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook-for-theme\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook -p 9001 -c .storybook-theme\\\"</span>\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook-for-app\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook -p 8001 -c .storybook-app\\\"</span>\\n   }\\n   ...\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Use multiple repos</h3>\\n<p>This is a popular option. You can create different repos for different kinds of UI components and have a storybook for each of them. Here are some ways to separate them:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Have one repo for the theme, and one for the app.</li>\\n<li>Have one repo for each UI component and use those in different apps.</li>\\n<li>Have a few repos for different kinds of UI components and use them in different apps.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/react-storybook/basics/writing-stories/index.md\n// module id = 517\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"id\":\"add-custom-head-tags\",\"title\":\"Add Custom Head Tags\",\"body\":\"<p>Sometimes, you may need to add different tags to the HTML head.

This is how to do it.\\nSimply add the following content to a file called <code>webpack.config.js</code> in your Storybook config directory (<code>.storybook</code> by default ).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> path = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'path'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.scss$/</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"style\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"css\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"sass\\\"</span>],\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: path.resolve(__dirname, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../'</span>)\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Since this config file stays in the Storybook directory, you need to set the include path as above. If the config directory stays in a different directory, you need to set the include path relative to that.</p>\\n<p>You also need to install the loaders (style, css, and sass) used in above config manually.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Once you create this <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, Storybook won’t load the <a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/configurations/default-config\\\">default Webpack config</a> other than loading JS files with the Babel loader.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>Supported Webpack Options</h3>\\n<p>You can add any kind of Webpack configuration options with the above config, whether they are plugins, loaders, or aliases.\\nBut you won’t be able to change the following config options:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>entry</li>\\n<li>output</li>\\n<li>js loader with babel</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Full Control Mode</h2>\\n<p>Sometimes, you will want to have full control over the webpack configuration. Maybe you want to add different configurations for dev and production environments. That’s where you can use our full control mode.</p>\\n<p>To enable that, you need to export a <strong>function</strong> from the above <code>webpack.config.js</code> file, just like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Export a function. Accept the base config as the only param.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">storybookBaseConfig, configType</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// configType has a value of 'DEVELOPMENT' or 'PRODUCTION'</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// You can change the configuration based on that.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 'PRODUCTION' is used when building the static version of storybook.</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Make whatever fine-grained changes you need</span>\\n  storybookBaseConfig.module.loaders.push({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.scss$/</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"style\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"css\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"sass\\\"</span>],\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: path.resolve(__dirname, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../'</span>)\\n  });\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Return the altered config</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> storybookBaseConfig;\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Storybook uses the config returned from the above function. So, try to edit the <code>storybookBaseConfig</code> with care. Make sure to preserve the following config options:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>entry</li>\\n<li>output</li>\\n<li>first loader in the module.loaders (Babel loader for JS)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Other than that, you should try to keep the default set of plugins.</p>\\n<h2>Extending The Default Config</h2>\\n<p>You may want to keep Storybook’s <a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/configurations/default-config\\\">default config</a>, but just need to extend it. If so, this is how you do it using the Full Control Mode.\\nAdd following content to the <code>webpack.config.js</code> in your Storybook config directory.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// load the default config generator.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> genDefaultConfig = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook/dist/server/config/defaults/webpack.config.js'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">config, env</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> config = genDefaultConfig(config, env);\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Extend it as you need.</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> config;\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Using Your Existing Config</h2>\\n<p>You may have an existing Webpack config for your project. So, you may need to copy and paste some config items into Storybook’s custom Webpack config file.</p>\\n<p>But you don’t need to. There are a few options:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Simply import your main Webpack config into Storybook’s <code>webpack.config.js</code> and use the loaders and plugins used in that.</li>\\n<li>Create a new file with common Webpack options and use it in both inside the main Webpack config and inside Storybook’s <code>webpack.config.js</code>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/react-storybook/configurations/custom-webpack-config/index.md\n// module id = 521\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"id\":\"default-config\",\"title\":\"Default Config\",\"body\":\"<p>Storybook has a default Webpack setup which is similar to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">Create React App</a>.\\nLet’s learn about the default config comes with Storybook.</p>\\n<h2>Babel</h2>\\n<p>We use Babel for JavaScript(ES6) transpiling. Here are some key features of Storybook’s Babel configurations.</p>\\n<h3>ES2016+ Support</h3>\\n<p>We have added ES2016 support with Babel for transpiling your JS code. In addition to that, we’ve added a few experimental features, like object spreading and async await. Check out our <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/blob/master/packages/react-storybook/src/server/config/babel.js#L19\\\">source</a> to learn more about these plugins.</p>\\n<h3>.babelrc support</h3>\\n<p>If your project has a <code>.babelrc</code> file, we’ll use that instead of the default config file. So, you could use any babel plugins or presets that you have used in your project with Storybook.</p>\\n<h2>Webpack</h2>\\n<p>We use Webpack to serve and load JavaScript modules for the web. We’ve added some Webpack loaders to bring some good defaults. (This setup is very close to what you get with the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">Create React App</a>.)</p>\\n<h3>CSS Support</h3>\\n<p>You can simply import CSS files wherever you want, whether it’s in the storybook config file, a UI component, or inside a story definition file.</p>\\n<p>Basically, you can import CSS like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// locally</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./styles.css'</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// or from NPM modules</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'</span>;\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Image and Static File Support</h3>\\n<p>You can also import images and media files directly via JavaScript. This helps you to write stories with media files easily. This is how to do it:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, action } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> imageFile <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./static/image.png'</span>;\\n\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&lt;img&gt;'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with a image'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">img</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{imageFile}</span> /&gt;</span>\\n  ));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>When you are building a storybook, we’ll also export the imported image. So, this is a good approach to loading all of your static content.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Storybook also has a way to mention static directories via the -s option of the <code>react-storybook</code> and <code>build-storybook</code> commands.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>JSON Loader</h3>\\n<p>You can import <code>.json</code> files, as you do with Node.js. This will also allow you to use NPM projects, which imports <code>.json</code> files inside them.</p>\\n<h2>NPM Modules</h2>\\n<p>You can use any of the NPM modules installed on your project. You can simply import and use them.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Unfortunately, we don’t support Meteor packages. If your UI component includes one or more Meteor packages, try to avoid using them in UI components.\\nIf they are containers, you can use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kadirahq/react-stubber\\\">React Stubber</a> to use them in Storybook.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/react-storybook/configurations/default-config/index.md\n// module id = 522\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"body\":\"<hr>\\n<h2>id: 'env-vars’\\ntitle: ‘Using Environment Variables’</h2>\\n<p>Sometimes, we may use configuration items inside Storybook. It might be a theme color, some client secret, or a JSON string. So, we usually tend to hard code them.</p>\\n<p>But you can expose those configurations via “environment variables.” For that, you need to prefix your environment variables with <code>STORYBOOK_</code> prefix.</p>\\n<p>For an example, let’s expose two environment variables like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">STORYBOOK_THEME=red STORYBOOK_DATA_KEY=12345 npm run storybook\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then we can access these environment variables anywhere inside our JS code like below:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(process.env.STORYBOOK_THEME)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(process.env.STORYBOOK_DATA_KEY)\\n</code></pre>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Even though we can access these env variables anywhere in the client side JS code, it’s better to use them only inside stories and inside the main Storybook config file.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Build time environment variables</h2>\\n<p>You can also pass these environment variables when you are <a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/basics/exporting-storybook\\\">building your storybook</a> with <code>build-storybook</code>.</p>\\n<p>Then they’ll be hard coded to the static version of your Storybook.</p>\\n<h2>NODE_ENV env variable</h2>\\n<p>In addition to the above prefixed environment variables, you can also pass the NODE_ENV variable to Storybook. But, you normally don’t need to do that since we set a reasonable default value for it.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>When running <code>npm run storybook</code>, we set NODE_ENV to ‘development’</li>\\n<li>When building storybook, we set NODE_ENV to ‘production’</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/react-storybook/configurations/env-vars/index.md\n// module id = 523\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"id\":\"serving-static-files\",\"title\":\"Serving Static Files\",\"body\":\"<p>It’s often useful to load static files like images and videos when creating components and stories.</p>\\n<p>Storybook provides two ways to do that.</p>\\n<h2>1.

Via a Directory</h2>\\n<p>You can also configure a directory (or a list of directories) for searching static content when you are starting Storybook. You can do that with the -s flag.</p>\\n<p>See the following npm script on how to use it:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook -s ./public -p 9001\\\"</span>\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Here <code>./public</code> is our static directory. Now you can use static files in the public directory in your components or stories like this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, action } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// assume image.png is located in the \\\"public\\\" directory.</span>\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&lt;img&gt;'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with a image'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">img</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"/image.png\\\"</span> /&gt;</span>\\n  ));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>You can also pass a list of directories, instead of a single directory, as shown below.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start-storybook -s ./public,./static -p 9001\\\"</span>\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Absolute versus relative paths</h2>\\n<p>Sometimes, you may want to deploy your storybook into a subpath, like <a href=\\\"https://kadira-samples.github.io/react-button\\\">https://kadira-samples.github.io/react-button</a>.</p>\\n<p>In this case, you need to have all your images and media files with relative paths. Otherwise, Storybook cannot locate those files.</p>\\n<p>If you load static content via importing, this is automatic and you do not have to do anything.</p>\\n<p>If you are using a static directory, then you need to use <em>relative paths</em> to load images.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/react-storybook/configurations/serving-static-files/index.md\n// module id = 524\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"id\":\"css-style-testing\",\"title\":\"CSS/Style Testing\",\"body\":\"<p>We can also use Storybook as the base for CSS/Style testing with stories as the base.

There are also a lot of tools and techniques we can use.</p>\\n<h2>Reasons for Testing</h2>\\n<p>Before we talk about testing, we need to think about why we need to test. There are many reasons; here are some of our reasons:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>To find bugs.</li>\\n<li>To make sure things won’t break between new code commits.</li>\\n<li>To keep tests as living documentations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Specifically, testing is important when working with teams since it allows different people the ability to contribute with confidence.</p>\\n<h2>Different Aspects of UI Testing</h2>\\n<p>We refer UI for many things. To put this in focus, let’s narrow it down to React based user interfaces.</p>\\n<h3>1. Structural Testing</h3>\\n<p>Here we’ll focus on the structure of the UI and how it’s laid out. For an example, let’s say we have a “login component” as shown below:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/login_form.png\\\" alt=\\\"Login Form\\\"></p>\\n<p>For structural testing, we are testing whether or not it has following content:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A title with “Login in to Facebook”</li>\\n<li>Two inputs for the username and password.</li>\\n<li>A submit button.</li>\\n<li>An error screen to show errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For React, we have been using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme\\\">Enzyme</a> as a way to do structural testing, but now we can also use <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html\\\">Jest’s snapshot testing</a> to make things even more simple.</p>\\n<h3>2. Interaction Testing</h3>\\n<p>UI is all about interacting with the user. We do this with a bunch of UI elements, such as buttons, links, and input elements. With interaction testing, we need to test if they are working properly.</p>\\n<p>Let’s again use the above login component as an example. It should do these things:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>When we click the submit button, it should give us the username and password.</li>\\n<li>When we click the “Forgotten Account” link, it should redirect to a new page.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We have few ways to do this type of testing with React. The simple way is to use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme\\\">Enzyme</a>.</p>\\n<h3>3. CSS/Style Testing</h3>\\n<p>UI is all about styles (whether they’re simple, beautiful, or even ugly). With style testing, we are evaluating the look and feel of our UI components between code changes. This is a pretty complex subject and usually we do it by comparing images.</p>\\n<p>If we are using inline styles all the way, we can use JEST snapshot testing. But to get even better results, we should consider using tools such as:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS\\\">BackstopJS</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS\\\">PhantomCSS</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/gemini-testing/gemini\\\">Gemini</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/Galooshi/happo\\\">Happo</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>4. Manual Testing</h3>\\n<p>All the above sections are about testing with automated tools. But since we are building UI for humans, we must also manually test them to see how they feel.</p>\\n<p>Another reason for manual testing is for the better user experience.</p>\\n<p>We should always try to test our UI with the naked eye. For this, we can simply use our existing Storybook.This is something that we can’t automate(yet) and takes time. But it would be great if we could do this once in a while (especially with a major code changes).</p>\\n<h2>How Storybook Can Help Us</h2>\\n<p>A <strong>story</strong> is a smallest unit in Storybook. It’s a fully functioning UI element where the input can be used for any of the testing methods we’ve mentioned above.</p>\\n<p>Let’s look at how Storybook can help you do the above mentioned different aspects of testing.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/testing/structural-testing\\\">Structural Testing with StoryShots</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/testing/interaction-testing\\\">Interaction Testing with Specs Addon</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/testing/css-style-testing\\\">Storybook as the Base for CSS/Style Testing</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/testing/manual-testing\\\">Storybook for Manual UI Testing</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/react-storybook/testing/react-ui-testing/index.md\n// module id = 528\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"id\":\"structural-testing\",\"title\":\"Structural Testing\",\"body\":\"<p>For React, <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html\\\">Jest’s snapshot testing</a> is the best way to do Structural Testing. It’s painless to use and maintain. We’ve integrated Jest’s snapshot testing directly into Storybook using a new tool called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storyshots\\\">StoryShots</a>. Now we can simply use existing stories as the input for snapshot testing.</p>\\n<h2>What’s Snapshot Testing?</h2>\\n<p>With Snapshot testing, we keep a file copy of the structure of UI components. Think of it like a set of HTML sources.</p>\\n<p>Then, after we’ve completed any UI changes, we compare new snapshots with the snapshots that we kept in the file.</p>\\n<p>If things are not the same, we can do two things:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>We can consider new snapshots that show the current state, and then update them as new snapshots.</li>\\n<li>We can find the root cause for the change and fix our code.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>We can also commit these snapshots directly into the source code.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Using StoryShots</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/storyshots\\\">StoryShots</a> is our integration between Storybook and Jest Snapshot Testing. It’s pretty simple to use.</p>\\n<p>First, make sure you are inside a Storybook-enabled repo (make sure it has few stories).\\nThen, install StoryShots into your app with:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">npm i -D @kadira/storyshots\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then, add the following NPM script into your package.json:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"test-storybook\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"storyshots\\\"</span>\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can run the above command with:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sh\\\">npm run <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">test</span>-storybook\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This will save the initial set of snapshots inside your Storybook config directory.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/storyshots-first-run.png\\\" alt=\\\"StoryShots First \\\"></p>\\n<p>After you complete any changes, you can run the above NPM script again and find our structural changes.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/storyshots-diff-view.png\\\" alt=\\\"StoryShots Diff View\\\"></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>StoryShots also comes with a few important <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/storyshots#key-features\\\">productive features</a> that can be customized. Have a look at the StoryShots <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/storyshots\\\">repo</a> for more information.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/react-storybook/testing/structural-testing/index.md\n// module id = 529\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Modules used on this site\",\"body\":\"<p>A real documentation site would have live examples here.
